Hi! I'm Xavi Guardiola <sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>. I was born and still live in El Vendrell, Catalonia.

On my CV it says I'm a **Data Scientist**. However, I see myself more as a **Polymath**. I love learning about all kinds of things despite not being good at any.

As a kid my dream was to create **video-games**. However, I ended up being a **scientist**. Blame Carl Sagan for that. I got my **Ph.D in Physics** back in 2001 working on Complex Systems <sup>[[2]](#footnote2)</sup>. Since then, I've been working on what nowadays people call **Data Science** at 3 start-up companies I cofounded (Simpple, Woices and Ilustrum) and now at King (Activision-Blizzard). So, guess what, I ended up working in video-games.

For all the gory details, check my [linked in profile](http://linkedin.com/in/xavierguardiola).

This site is a **multilingual assembly of random stuff**. Do not expect much consistency or coherence. Actually, this is my third attempt at keeping a blog alive, after [Tocant al Panor√†mic (2004-05)](http://tocantalpanoramic.blogspot.com/) and [L'illa del logaritme (2007-09)](http://illadellogaritme.blogspot.com/). You've been warned. 

X.

<a name="footnote2">[2]</a>: **I love books!** Few things bring me more joy than recommending them. So I will seize this opportunity to illustrate the things I worked on while I was still in the academia with these wonderful popular science books. All of them are a pleasure to read!
